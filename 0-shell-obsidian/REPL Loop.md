The **Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL)** is an interactive programming environment commonly used in languages like Python, Lisp, Ruby, and JavaScript. It works as follows:

1.  **Read**: Takes input from the user (usually a single line of code).
    
2.  **Eval** (Evaluate): Processes the input and executes the code.
    
3.  **Print**: Displays the result of the evaluation to the user.
    
4.  **Loop**: Repeats the process for the next input.
