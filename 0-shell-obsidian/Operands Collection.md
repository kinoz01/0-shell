```rust
fn collect_operands(args: &[String]) -> Vec<String> {
    let mut out = Vec::new();
    let mut after_ddash = false;
    for a in args {
        if !after_ddash && a == "--" {
            after_ddash = true;
            continue;
        }
        if !after_ddash && a.starts_with('-') && a != "-" {
            continue;
        }
        if fs::symlink_metadata(a).is_err() {
            eprintln!("ls: cannot access '{}': No such file or directory", a);
        } else {
            out.push(a.clone());
        }
    }
    out
}
```

This function processes the command-line arguments and **collects valid operands**â€”that is, file or directory names that `ls` should act on.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

```rust
let mut out = Vec::new();
let mut after_ddash = false;
```

-   `out`: The list of valid operands to return.
    
-   `after_ddash`: Tracks if we've encountered `--`, which marks the end of flags.

### ðŸš¦ Main Loop Over Arguments

```rust
for a in args {
    if !after_ddash && a == "--" {
        after_ddash = true;
        continue;
    }
```

-   If the argument is `--` and we havenâ€™t seen it before, we:
    
    -   Set `after_ddash = true`.
        
    -   Skip the rest of this iteration (`continue`) to move on to the next argument.
        
-   From this point on, all arguments are treated as operands (not flags).
    

---

```rust
if !after_ddash && a.starts_with('-') && a != "-" {
        continue;
    }
```

-   If the argument is a flag (e.g. `-a`, `-l`, `-F`) **and** we haven't yet seen `--`, skip it. These arenâ€™t operands.
    

---

```rust
if fs::symlink_metadata(a).is_err() {
        eprintln!("ls: cannot access '{}': No such file or directory", a);
    } else {
        out.push(a.clone());
    }
```

-   `fs::symlink_metadata(a)` tries to read metadata about the path **without following symlinks** (more on symlinks below).
    
-   If it **fails** (file doesn't exist or isn't accessible):
    
    -   Print an error message (mimicking Unix `ls` behavior).
        
-   If it **succeeds**, the argument is a valid operand and is added to `out`.
    

---

### âœ… Return

```rust
out
```

-   Returns the collected and validated list of file/directory operands.

## ðŸ”— What the Heck is a Symlink?

### ðŸ“Œ Symlink (Symbolic Link) â€“ Defined

A **symlink** is a special type of file that acts as a **pointer or shortcut** to another file or directory.

-   Think of it like a desktop shortcut in Windows or an alias in macOS.
    
-   It's **not** the actual file, but a reference to its path.
    

### ðŸ”§ Example

```bash
$ ln -s /real/path/to/file linkname
```

-   Now `linkname` is a symlink pointing to `/real/path/to/file`.
    

### ðŸ“˜ Why Use `symlink_metadata`?

-   `fs::metadata(path)` follows symlinks and returns info about the target.
    
-   `fs::symlink_metadata(path)` gives metadata **about the symlink itself**, not its target.
    

In this program, `symlink_metadata` is used to:

-   Check whether a file or directory **exists** (even if it's a symlink).
    
-   **Avoid following broken links**, which could mislead the program.
